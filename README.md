# Grid-View
In this program, you can upload, save and display images in the GridView control. This project is written with ASP.Net web design language.
This interesting project, written using the #C programming language and asp.net web design language, teaches you very good control over GridView.
In the image upload source, the asp.net page uses the Cached Database, SqlExpress.
By launching a program, the screen displays images in the sqlExpress database inside a GridView control with id and the name of the photo beautifully. This page also includes a "upload" button, which uses two textboxes next to it to enter the name and address of the image you want to upload, and by clicking the button, the image is displayed with the logged in GridView And stored in the SqlExpress database.
In the event of a click on the upload option, the size of the selected image is changed according to the size of the gridview sections, and then uses the SqlConnection class to communicate with the database and store the image there.
